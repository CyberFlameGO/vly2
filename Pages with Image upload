Pages with Image upload

Person profile PersonDetailForm
after upload img is shown on left column
because we have complex avatar sizes we use local state to force the field to update

after upload image is not updated but URL is in edit field.
tie the img src to getFieldValue and it works.

OpFormImg - unused
short form doesn't allow for changing image

OrgDetailForm - doesn't show uploaded pic

AboutYou.js - post sign up - correct.
