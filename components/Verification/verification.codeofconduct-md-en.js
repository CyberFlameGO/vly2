# Being a great volunteer

In order to support safety and trust in our community, we have a code of conduct all volunteers need to follow in your heart. This code sets out principles and behaviours that the Voluntarily community reasonably expects of people participating in voluntarily activities.

### Basic Principles

The community expects volunteers to:

* Conduct themselves honestly and in good faith at all times.
* Comply with all laws, including sale of goods and intellectual property laws.
* Comply with Voluntariliyâ€™s terms and conditions.
* Accept the full Code of Conduct and Terms of Use.
