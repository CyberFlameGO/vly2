# We care about Privacy

Your privacy is really important to us, as is the privacy of the people you're supporting.
Our privacy policy is as follows:

### Basic Principles

* We will do our best to keep your connections with other people secure
* if a person you are helping or being helped by shares their contact details, keep it to yourself unless they say its fine to share.
* Try to be kind, and to support those around you on the platform. 
We'll try to do the same for you.
