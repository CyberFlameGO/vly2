# Being a great volunteer

In order to support safety and trust in our community, we have a code of conduct all volunteers need to follow in your heart. This code sets out principles and behaviours that the Voluntarily community reasonably expects of people participating in Voluntarily activities.

### Basic Principles

The community expects volunteers to

* Conduct themselves honestly and in good faith at all times
* Comply with all laws, including sale of goods and intellectual property laws
* Comply with Voluntarilyâ€™s terms and conditions
* Accept the full [Code of Conduct](/terms/conduct) and [Terms of Use](/terms)
